Somewhere far far away, there is a village which is controlled by a dark and cunning witch.
Coincidentally, this witch is also a die-hard programmer.
The witch has power to control death and life of the villager.

On the 4th year she kills 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7 villagers
On the 5th year she kills 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12 villagers
